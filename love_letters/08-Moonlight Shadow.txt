the last that ever she saw him,她最后一次见到他,
carried away by a moonlight shadow,但因月光的影子而失去意识,
he passed on worried and warning,他发出了警讯,
carried away by a moonlight shadow,但因月光的影子而失去意识,
lost in a riddle that saturday night,上个周末的夜晚已在河里迷失,
far away on the other side,在遥远的那一边,
he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight,他被困在一场亡命的打斗中,
and she couldn't find how to push through.而她却无能为力
the trees that whisper in the evening,树林在黄昏时分低语,
carried away by a moonlight shadow,但因月光的影子而失去意识,
sing the song of sorrow and grieving,唱一首关于忧愁与悔恨的歌曲,
carried away by a moonlight shadow,但因月光的影子而失去意识,
all she saw was a silhouette of a gun,她看到的是一把枪的轮廓,
far away on the other side,在遥远的那一边,
he was shot six times by a man on the run,他被一个奔跑的男子连开六枪,
and she couldn't find how to push through.而她却无能为力.
i stay, i pray,我停留,我祈祷,
see you in heaven far away,在遥远的天堂相见,
i stay, i pray,我停留,我祈祷,
see you in heaven one day.总有一天在天堂相见.
four a.m. in the morning,凌晨四点钟,
carried away by a moonlight shadow,但因月光的影子而失去意识,
i watched your vision forming,我注视着你的幻影形成,
carried away by a moonlight shadow,但因月光的影子而失去意识,
star were glowing in the silvery night,银色的夜晚星光璀璨,
far away on the other side,在遥远的那一边,
will you come to talk to me this night,今晚你会来找我吗?
but she couldn't find how to push through.但是她却无能为力.
i stay, i pray,我停留,我祈祷,
see you in heaven far away,在遥远的天堂相见,
i stay, i pray,我停留,我祈祷,
see you in heaven one day.总有一天在天堂相见.

Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive,
But she couldn't find how to push through.

Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Far away on the other side.
But she couldn't find how to push through.
