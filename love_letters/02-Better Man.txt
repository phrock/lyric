send someone to love me
i need to rest in arms
keep me safe from harm
in pouring rain
give me endless summer
lord i fear the cold
feel i'm getting old
before my time
as my soul heals the shame
i will grow through this pain
lord i'm doing all i can
to be a better man

go easy on my conscience
'cause it's not my fault
i know i've been taught
to take the blame
rest assured my angels
will catch my tears
walk me out of here
i'm in pain
as my soul heals the shame
i will grow through this pain
lord i'm doing all i can
to be a better man

once you've found that lover
you're homeward bound
love is all around
love is all around
i know some have fallen on stony ground
but love is all around

send someone to love me
i need to rest in arms
keep me safe from harm
in pouring rain
give me endless summer
lord i fear the cold
feel i'm getting old
before my time
as my soul heals the shame
i will grow through this pain
lord i'm doing all i can
to be a better man
