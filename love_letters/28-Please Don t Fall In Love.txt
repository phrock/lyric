I know that you're with him just now as i write
I know you need someone to hold you at night
But i'm begging you, baby
Please don't fall in love
I knew it might happen when i was away
And now that it's happened, i just want to say
That i'm begging you, baby
Please don't fall in love
I'm usually strong but i'm feeling so weak
It wells up inside me, i cry when i speak
But the more i call you on the phone
The more i feel alone
And the less we have to say
I know that you're with him just now as i write
I know you need someone to hold you at night
But i'm begging you, baby
Please don't fall in love
I knew it might happen when i was away
And now that it's happened, i just want to say
That i'm begging you, baby
Please don't fall in love
We kissed at the airport, we said we could wait
I believe it is we who determine our fate
And i love you more than i can say
Don't throw it all away
Don't let it go by
I know that you're with him just now as i write
I know you need someone to hold you at night
But i'm begging you, baby
Please don't fall in love
I know you don't tell me, to spare me the pain
Don't want you to tell me, i don't need his name
That i'm begging you, baby
Please don't fall in love
