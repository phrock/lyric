Sandy
Stranded at the drive in, branded a fool, what will they say Monday at
school?
Sandy, can't you see, I'm in misery
We made a start, now we're apart, there's nothin' left for me
Love has flown all alone, I sit and wonder why-yy oh why you left me,
oh Sandy
Oh Sandy, maybe someday, when highschool is done
Somehow, someway, our two worlds will be one
In heaven forever and ever we will be, oh please say you'll stay, oh
Sandy
Sandy my darlin', you hurt me real bad, you know it's true
But baby, you gotta believe me when I say, I'm helpless without you
Love has flown all alone, I sit, I wonder why-yy oh why you left me, oh
Sandy
Sandy, Sandy, why-yyy, oh Sandy
