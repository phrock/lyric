it's over and done
but the heartache lives on inside
and who's the one you're clinging to
instead of me tonight?
and where are you now, now that i need you?
tears on my pillow wherever you go
i'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
you never see me fall apart
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taken me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
but if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
dont you know there's nobody left in this world
to hold me tight
nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
goodnight, goodnight
i'm there at your side,
i'm part of all the things you are
but you've got a part of someone else
you've got to find your shining star
and where are you now, now that i need you?
tears on my pillow wherever you go
i'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
you never see me fall apart
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taken me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
but if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
dont you know there's nobody left in this world
to hold me tight
nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
goodnight, goodnight
and where are you now, now that i need you?
tears on my pillow wherever you go
i'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
you never see me fall apart
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taken me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
but if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
don't you know there's nobody left in this world
to hold me tight
nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
goodnight, goodnight
in the words of a broken heart
it's just emotion that's taken me over
caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
but if you don't come back
come home to me, darling
