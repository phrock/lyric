turn around
every now and then i get a little bit
lonely and you're never coming round.
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit
tired of listening to the sound of my tears.
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit
nervous that the rest of all the years have gone by.
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit
terrified and then i see the look in your eyes.
turn around, bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart.
turn around, bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart.

and i need you now tonight
and i need you more than ever
and if you only hold me tight
we'll be holding on forever.
and we'll only be making it right
'cause we'll never be wrong.
together we can take it to the end of the line.
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.
(all of the time)
i don't know what to do and i'm always in the dark.
we're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.
i really need you tonight,
forever's gonna start tonight,
forever's gonna start tonight.

once upon a time i was falling in love
but now i'm only falling apart.
there's nothing i can do,
a total eclipse of the heart.


once upon a time there was light in my life
but now there's only love in the dark.
nothing i can say,
a total eclipse of the heart.


and i need you now tonight
and i need you more than ever
and if you only hold me tight
we'll be holding on forever.
and we'll only be making it right
'cause we'll never be wrong.
together we can take it to the end of the line.
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.
(all of the time)
i don't know what to do and i'm always in the dark.
we're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.
i really need you tonight,
forever's gonna start tonight,
forever's gonna start tonight.

once upon a time i was falling in love
but now i'm only falling apart.
there's nothing i can say,
a total eclipse of the heart.
a total eclipse of the heart.
oh,a total eclipse of the heart.
