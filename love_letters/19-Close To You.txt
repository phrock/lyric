Silence fills my room
I'm so all alone
I dream of you lying here next to me
I wanna hold you in my arms
Underneath the stars
Feel the wind blowing thru your hair
Your hand in mine
I adore you,please don't ever go
Keep you close to me,cause I need you so

Imagine you and me,in a field of dreams
The earth is still and time never ends
I climb the highest mountain
Just to be with you
When you're near
I feel warm inside
We'll be as one
I adore you,please don't ever go
Keep you close to me,cause I need you so
oh,oh,oh
