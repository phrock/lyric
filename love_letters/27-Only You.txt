Only you
Have the power to move me
And together we'll make The whole world move in sympathy
But I could not see before
Take me hold me mould me Change me and improve me
It's not funny anymore
There was I
Wondering why I was wondering why
Every day
Disappeared into the distance
Now with you
The light is shining through
You gave me life not just existence
Only you You are the starlight
Only you Have the power to move me
Wondering why
Every day disappeared into the distance
And together we'll make The whole world move in sympathy
That only you
Only you to me
