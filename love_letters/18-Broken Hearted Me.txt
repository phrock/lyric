Every now and then I cry
Every night, you keep staying on my mind
All my friends say Iï¼‡ll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can, when it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me

Everything is just the same
Playing games, different loves, different names
They keep saying I'll survive, it just takes time
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can, when it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No I don't see how it can while we are still apart
When you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted
Tine won't heal a broken hearted me
