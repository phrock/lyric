i'll wait here to play a song tonight
you'll be under the pale moonlight
with me, my love
i need you to show me your loving way
like a flower in the rain
so soft and all alone
to feel your touch
to see your smile
but i can't find you
hear your voice
taste your lips
you know i want to
to think of you
only you
you're on my mind
i'll wait here to play you a song tonight
to feel your touch
to see your smile
but i can't find you
to think of you
only you
you're on my mind
i need you to show me your loving way
like a flower in the rain
so soft and all alone
i'll wait here to play you a song tonight
you'll be under the pale under the pale under the pale moonlight
