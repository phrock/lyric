Oooh-oooh
Everybody's got something
They had to leave behind
One regret from yesterday
That just seems to grow with time
There's no use looking back or wondering
(Or wondering)
How it could be now or might have been
(Or might have been)
All this I know but still I can't find ways
To let you go

I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that Iï¼‡ve moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be with you, yeah

Somewhere in my memory
I've lost all sense of time (ah-ha, ha-ha)
And tommorow can never be
'Cos yesterday is all that fills my mind
There's no use looking back or wondering
(Wondering)
How it should be now or might have been
(Or might have been)
All this I know but still I can't find ways
To let you go

I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words to say
You're the one I think about each day
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be
You'll always be the dream that fills my head
Yes you will, say you will
You know you will, oh baby
You'll always be the one I know I'll never forget
It's no use looking back or wondering
(Or wondering)
Because love is a strange and funny thing
(And funny thing)
No matter how I try and try
I just can't say goodbye, no, no, no, no

I never had a dream come true
'Til the day that I found you
Even though I pretend that I've moved on
You'll always be my baby
I never found the words
(Never found the words to say) to say
You're the one I think about each day (each day)
And I know no matter where life takes me to
A part of me will always be
A part of me will always be with you, ooh
