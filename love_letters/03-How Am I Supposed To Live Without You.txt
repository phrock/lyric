I could hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leaving
Someone swept you heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true
So tell me all about it, tell me about the plans you're making
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

(I didn't come here for crying)
Too proud for crying
Didn't come here to breakdown
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you
When I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends
And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
When even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

And I don't wanna face the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Now that your dream has come true

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone
